## Features

### 1. X-ray Scanner

You can upload or take a picture of your X-ray. The app uses AI to analyze the image and explains the result in a way anyone can understand — no medical background needed.

### 2. Voice to Explanation

You can speak your symptoms out loud. The app listens and responds with suggestions as if you're talking to a doctor. It's helpful when you're unsure what's wrong or what to do next.

### 3. Medical Term Decoder

Upload your blood or lab report and the app will break down the meaning of each term. It highlights what’s normal, what’s not, and what you should know about it.

### 4. Tablet Analyzer

Scan any medicine strip or a prescription note. The app will identify the tablet, explain what it's used for, and tell you how and when to take it — along with any precautions.
